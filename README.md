main.py and MainLibrary.py is the file that I edit and work mostly on.
Other files are either files from Youtubers or files that I wrote and doesn't use (but I keep them for recall purposes).
There are two files in mp4 format from Kpop Idols that I use to test my codes

Today, I created a class for handling FaceDetection.
I also drew important points on the face and an axis of symmetry based on locations of eyes and nose.

Tomorrow, I will analyse those data

I am analysing my data and it's close to finished. Well, I may have to reinstall my OS

Oh I just forgot to say, I've finished analysing my data using square error method and it works pretty well.

Wow I just lost my Arduino Board. Now I'll have to buy another :<
Instead of buying another Arduino Board, I believe I can simulate it, but the connections between Python and Arduino might get a little complicated.
It seems Proteus is able to animate Arduino but it requires a hex file which is created after running the codes.
So... I'm trying to figure out how to run my code in real time with Proteus
